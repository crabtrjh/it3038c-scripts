# What the script does:
	* My project 2 script allows you to play rock papaer scissors aganist a computer opponent. The script when run will give the player a menu choosing to either play the game or exit the game.
	Once the player has chosen to play the scipt will allow the player to input their choice of rock paper of scissors and then will have the computer opponent randomly choose one of the options.
	
# The output of the script:
	* The output of the script should first provide the player with a place to enter their name. Then the script provides a menu to either chose to play the game or exit.
	Once the player has chosen to play the game the game will prompt them to input their choice for the game. It also additonally allows for the player to tpye "help" to get instructions for the game.
	Once the player has entered their input the computer will then randomly choose its answer choice. Finally the script will then output who won between the player and computer or if the game was a draw.
	
# Running the Script:
	* To run the script i would recommend opening up visual studio code creating a new file, inputting the script and then saving the file as a python file.
		* This will allow for the script tp be run correctly within visual stuido code.
	* All that is required to run the script is to hit the run button in visual studio code.
	* Or by going to the run drop down menu and select "Run without Debugging"
