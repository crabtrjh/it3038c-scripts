# What the script does:
	* My project 2 script allows you to play rock papaer scissors aganist a computer opponent. The script when run will allow the player to 
	input their choice of rock paper of scissors and then will have the computer opponent randomly choose one of the options.
	
# The output of the script:
	* The output of the script should provide the user a line to input their choice for the game and then should output the answer for the computer opponent.
	
# Running the Script:
	* All that is required to run the script is to hit the run button in visual studio code.
